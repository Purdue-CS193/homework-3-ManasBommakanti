Q1: What are the 3 commands to transfer something from your local codebase to GitHub?
  You have to add, commit, and push, in that order.

Q2: What does 'git clone' do? 
  It clones the repository to a specified location of your own.

Q3: What does 'git status' do?
  This displays the state of the working directory and staging area.

Q4: What does "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'" tell you?
  That means that your code is saved up to the latest version.

Q5: You’ve made a change to a file in GitHub, the one on the browser, and now you run 'git status' on the terminal. It still says "Up to Date" despite the change. What command do you need to enter first?
  git pull


Q6: You’ve just ran the 'rm' command and deleted an important file. All your code is deleted, not including the local repository. You only ran 'git add' and 'git commit' before the rogue command. Is your code saved?
  Yes, the .git file is still there.


Q7: Your computer crashes and all your code is deleted, including the local repository. You only ran 'git add' and 'git commit'. Is your code saved?
  No, because the .git file is also deleted along with the repository.
